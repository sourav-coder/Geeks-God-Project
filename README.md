**Setup Instructions**  

As mentioned earlier , this is a web development project where HTML5, CSS3,Boostrap is used for Frontend and php is used for backend development.   
The below mentioned steps may vary significantly across various operating systems, please follow them accordingly.

These instructions are aimed at a developer who has been added to the project team, after the project development has already been initiated,

Therefore the aim is to get the code from the git repository to run on the developer's system, so as to allow him / her to continue with further development.
